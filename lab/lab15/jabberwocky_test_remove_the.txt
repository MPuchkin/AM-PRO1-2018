'Twas brillig, and  slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in  wabe;
All mimsy were  borogoves,
And  mome raths outgrabe.

"Beware  Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite,  claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!"

He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time  manxome foe he sought—
So rested he by  Tumtum tree,
And stood awhile in thought.

And as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through  tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! and through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.

"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"
He chortled in his joy.

'Twas brillig, and  slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in  wabe;
All mimsy were  borogoves,
And  mome raths outgrabe
